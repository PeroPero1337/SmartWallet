# SmartWallet
 School group project

SmartWallet(renaming to SmartAssistant) is a mobile application that helps you keep track of you income, outcome, bills ect.
The application is being developed using Xamarin .
It currently only works on iOS

Will be renamed to Smart Assistant or something similar since it's not actually a wallet.
